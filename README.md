### [dapp-deploy](https://github.com/warren-bank/dapp-deploy)

#### Description:

Command-line tool to:
* deploy Ethereum contracts to a blockchain
* for each contract,<br>
  associate Ethereum network IDs to a list of addresses,<br>
  where each address represents a deployment of the contract onto that blockchain,<br>
  and store this metadata as a hashtable in a (small) JSON file

#### Installation:

```bash
npm install -g @warren-bank/dapp-deploy
```

*aside:*
* Before installation, you first might want to check whether your `$PATH` contains any conflicting symbolic links: `which dapp-deploy`
* Very [recently](https://github.com/dapphub/dapp/commit/d26ff7f598107665935860dd70d9fb2174b39966), the [`dapphub/dapp`](https://github.com/dapphub/dapp) toolchain added [`deploy`](https://github.com/dapphub/dapp/blob/master/libexec/dapp/dapp-deploy) to its set of included libraries. This command is currently an alias for (ie: symbolic link to) [`create`](https://github.com/dapphub/dapp/blob/master/libexec/dapp/dapp-create).

#### Simple Example:

```bash
lxterminal -e testrpc

mkdir ~/my_dapp
cd ~/my_dapp

dapp init
dapp deploy
```

#### Options:

```text
$ dapp-deploy --help

Tool to use in combination with 'dapphub/dapp'.
Uses artifacts generated by "dapp build".
Deploys compiled contract(s) to an Ethereum blockchain.

Each deployed contract address is saved to a JSON data file.
Format is a hash table:
    Ethereum network ID => array of addresses

Ethereum network ID represents a unique Ethereum blockchain.
Enables deployment to multiple chains.

A frontend Dapp can determine the current Ethereum network ID.
For each contract, the Dapp can perform the necessary lookup
in the corresponding hash table of deployment addresses.
Using web3.js, only 2 data files are needed per contract:
    ./out/CONTRACTNAME.abi
    ./out/CONTRACTNAME.deployed

Usage: dapp-deploy [options]


Options:
 --all                                Deploy all contracts  [boolean] [default: true]
 -c, --contract, --whitelist          Deploy specified contract(s)  [array]
 -x, --exclude_contract, --blacklist  Do not deploy specified contract(s)  [array]
 -l, --lib, --library                 Link specified library(s) to dependent deployment contract(s)
                                      note: The specified libary(s) won't be redeployed.  [array]
 --params                             Parameter(s) to pass to contract constructor(s)
                                      note: Addresses for previously deployed contracts (with metadata located at filepaths determined by "--output_pattern" and "--output_directory") can be referenced by passing a string parameter having the format: "{{CONTRACTNAME}}"
                                      note: Arrays can be encoded into JSON. Arrays may contain strings that reference the address of a previously deployed contract.
                                      note: In most situations, each contract having a constructor that accepts input parameters should be deployed individually, rather than in a batch. Please be careful.  [array] [default: []]
 --value, --wei                       Value (wei) to pass to contract constructor(s)
                                      note: In most situations, each contract having a payable constructor should be deployed individually, rather than in a batch. Please be careful.  [number] [default: 0]
 --gas                                Gas to send with each transaction
                                      note: In most situations, it would be better to not use this option. By default, the amount of gas sent is an estimate.  [number]
 -h, --host                           Ethereum JSON-RPC server hostname  [string] [default: "localhost"]
 -p, --port                           Ethereum JSON-RPC server port number  [number] [default: 8545]
 --tls, --https, --ssl                Require TLS handshake (https:) to connect to Ethereum JSON-RPC server  [boolean] [default: false]
 -a, --aa, --account_address          Address of Ethereum account to own deployed contracts  [string]
 -A, --ai, --account_index            Index of Ethereum account to own deployed contracts.
                                      note: List of available/unlocked accounts is determined by Ethereum client.  [number] [default: 0]
 -i, --input_directory                Path to input directory. All compiled contract artifacts are read from this directory.
                                      note: The default path assumes that the current directory is the root of a compiled "dapp" project.  [string] [default: "./out"]
 -o, --od, --output_directory         Path to output directory. All "CONTRACTNAME.deployed" JSON files will be written to this directory.  [string] [default: "./out"]
 -O, --op, --output_pattern           Pattern to specify absolute output file path. The substitution pattern "{{contract}}" will be interpolated.
                                      note: The substitution pattern is required.  [string]
 -v, --verbose                        Configure how much information is logged to the console during the deployment of contracts.  [count]
 -q, --quiet                          Disable log messages. Output is restricted to the address(es) of newly deployed contracts. If a single contract is specified, returns a string. Otherwise, returns a hash (name => address) in JSON format. This data can be piped to other applications.  [boolean] [default: false]
 --help                               Show help  [boolean]

#### Notes:

* This tool is standalone.
* It is intended to complement the [`dapphub/dapp`](https://github.com/dapphub/dapp) toolchain,<br>
  but it can also work directly with Solidity compiler (solc) output.
* When `dapp` is installed, this tool can be invoked by the command: `dapp deploy [options]`
* When used standalone, it can be invoked by the command: `dapp-deploy [options]`

#### Methodology:

* find all .bin and .abi files in "input directory"
* filter contracts that don't have both artifacts
* if whitelist: filter contracts that aren't in whitelist
* if blacklist: filter contracts that are in blacklist
* if libraries: filter contracts (ie: compiled libraries) that have a static address to which dependent contracts will be linked
* for each remaining contract, perform in parallel (first pass):
  * read code
  * determine dependent libraries (if any)
  * determine whether the deployed address of any dependent libraries is (as of yet) unknown
  * if so: save metadata and stop processing contract
  * otherwise: deploy contract, save address, write output file (.deployed)
* if first pass completes and there is saved metadata for unlinked contracts:
  * iterate through all unlinked contracts and attempt to redeploy
  * when iteration completes:
    * if the number of unlinked contracts is zero: success
    * if the number of unlinked contracts has decreased: recursively perform the iteration again
    * otherwise: failure => there are contract dependencies on libraries for which no address is available to link

#### Commentary:

* I'm fairly new to the Ethereum ecosystem.
* I've inspected various tools that assist with the development and testing of Solidity contracts
  * [Truffle](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle)
  * [Dapple](https://github.com/dapphub/dapple)
  * [Dapp](https://github.com/dapphub/dapp)
* I prefer `dapp` for the ability of its testing harness to debug deeply nested throws
* After a Solidity contract (or system of contracts) is ready for a front-end UI
  * the contracts need to be deployed to an Ethereum blockchain
    * most likely, this blockchain is a short-lived instance of `testrpc`;<br>
      in which case, redeployment is necessary each time the RPC server is restarted.
  * the addresses of these deployed contracts need to be saved,<br>
    and made available to the Dapp while it is being developed and tested.
* I've found the existing tools to be somewhat lacking for this purpose.<br>
  It's very possible that I'm mistaken and have re-invented the wheel.
  * `dapp` provides [`seth`](https://github.com/dapphub/seth) as its command-line tool to perform RPC calls.<br>
    It has many more features than this tool, but I find it lacking (and difficult to use) in a lot of ways.<br>
    Hopefully, it will continue to improve over time.
  * `dapple` provides [`DappleScript`](http://dapple.readthedocs.io/en/master/dapplescript/) as its Solidity-like language in which to write "migrations".<br>
    These migration scripts can be run on the command-line.<br>
    My impression is that it's a really nice system.<br>
    My only issue is that the scripting environment is very limiting.
    * can't work with complex data types
    * can't parse (or stringify) JSON data
    * can't write to the file system
  * `truffle` provides [`migrations`](http://truffleframework.com/docs/getting_started/migrations).<br>
    I haven't spent much time looking at this.<br>
    Initial impressions:
    * Pros:
      * scripting is done in a nodeJS javascript environment
      * can use a chain of promises to inspect the "instance" of each deployed contract
      * supports linking (which is something I may need to add)
    * Cons:
      * "Truffle requires you to have a Migrations contract in order to use the Migrations feature."
      * Personally, I don't plan to use Truffle to either test Solidity contracts or write front-end Dapps.<br>
        Though it could be used solely for generating deployment metadata,<br>
        which could then be consumed elsewhere,<br>
        I don't think that makes for a pleasant (or efficient) workflow.
